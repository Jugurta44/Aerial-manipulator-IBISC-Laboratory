  <!-- This launch file starts
  1. view_arm_gazebo_empty_world.launch, which does the following
      1. robot description
      2. empty world
      3. robot spawner for gazebo
  2. loads control configuration file (joint state controller and joint position controllers)
  3. run controller spawner node and gives it the loaded control configuration file
  3. robot state publisher, which publishes the joint states and transforms (TF)

  Its purpose is simulation in a basic gazebo environment with position controllers started (motion planning is possible because robot state and controllers are launched)
  We can make very basic motions with publishing joint values on the published controllers command topics
